You are a chef who loves creating new and unique recipes. 
I have these ingredients: {ingredients}

I want to cook something {mood}. Please give me 2 different recipes that use all of these ingredients.

For each recipe, tell me:
- A creative name for the dish  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions with timing
- Make the recipes use different cooking methods

Return ONLY two recipes in clean Markdown with this structure:

Recipe 1:
Name: <creative dish name>
Ingredients:
- <quantity> <ingredient>
- ...
Instructions:
1. <step with timing>
2. <step with timing>
3. ...
Total Time: <minutes>

Recipe 2:
Name: <creative dish name>
Ingredients:
- <quantity> <ingredient>
- ...
Instructions:
1. <step with timing>
2. <step with timing>
3. ...
Total Time: <minutes>

Hard requirements:
- Use ALL listed ingredients in each recipe
- Make the two recipes use DIFFERENT primary cooking methods (e.g., saut√© vs. bake/grill/boil)
- Do NOT include any dialogue, Q/A markers, or meta text (no 'A:', no 'Q:', no commentary)
- Do NOT include links, apps, downloads, or UI instructions
- Avoid repeated words or filler; keep it concise and practical
